                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>Obesity is a recurring problem for people in today's society, and the phenomenon of obesity is linked to fat cells. By exploring the movement of fat cells, I hope to show this process of fat cells in constant movement through code and combine it with different high calorie foods, merging the cell movement in the body after consuming these foods with the surface of the food, showing the merging of the inside of the fat cells with the outside, so that when people see these foods they will think about how much fat they are consuming and that this fat will be in their increasing in quantity and size in the body. It reminds people to reduce their intake of high calorie foods to prevent the problem of obesity.</p>
