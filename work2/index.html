                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>It is a human characteristic that everyone living in society will join some groups to a greater or lesser extent. Joining a group unites the masses and gives them more power, but it also saps their individuality and gives them characteristics such as emotionalism, non-disagreement and low intelligence. When groups are controlled by people with an agenda they can also harm society. I use the light strips to represent different groups of people, as each person has their own light and colour, and when triggered different buttons use different effects to represent different people, and use the motor to drive the fan to cause damage to the surroundings. By allowing the audience to experience the installation, it provokes thoughts about the individual and the group, reminding people to maintain their own views and identity within the group.</p>
