                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>My project mainly uses the combination of gesture recognition model and Arduino to create an interactive device. First of all, the movement of hands is also a way of self-expression, so I chose to use hands as the input form, and the audience can express their goodwill or malice through different gestures. After the camera captures the audience's gestures, different motors will be driven. Each motor has a different appearance and meaning, and has a different impact on the model in the middle. I hope that the audience can use this work to realize that it is not a small act of kindness, and it is not a small act of evil. Every good intention and malice you have will have an impact on others. It may be only subtle, but the cumulative effect is huge.</p>
