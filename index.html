                <p>My name is Yanyu Zhang, and I usually use a combination of physical devices and computer programming to explore computer art.I like to explore topics related to people and society, and I hope that through my works, I can bring the audience's attention to the small and insignificant things in daily life, thus affecting everyone in society.I like to study the combination of different materials and programming, where the material is my appearance and the programming is my core, together combining to produce the ideal artwork.</p>
