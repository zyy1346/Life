                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>Nowadays, as the pace of life becomes faster and faster, people's mental problems, such as anxiety, low self-esteem, social disorders and so on, have gradually appeared. Under such circumstances, people are in urgent need of spiritual healing, and art has had the power to heal since ancient times, and art healing has gradually developed. Art therapist Judith A. Rubin once said, "Art has the power to heal, transform and empower individuals." My project started with the topic of art healing and I hope to incorporate the healing power of art into my work. The elements of nature, wind, fire, trees, etc. all have a powerful life force and energy, and people are often in touch with nature to relieve their emotions. So I bring the elements of nature into my work and express them in the form of code, computational art, so that the work has a kind of dynamic life force. The audience can interact with the artwork by touching the button to let it monitor the audience's heartbeat, the light will flash according to the audience's heartbeat frequency and cooperate with the motor to create dynamic, wonderful paintings and light and shadow. I hope that the viewers can feel the vibrant life force through my work, and that it will have a healing effect on the hearts of those who are experiencing difficulties.</p>
